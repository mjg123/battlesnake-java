intro battlesnake
 - what is battlesnake?
 - how do you play?
 - game modes: challenges and tournaments
 - why is mine the okayest?


** Section 2: How I built the world's okayest (20 mins)

1. snake design basics
 - webserver, Spring boot + Java records
   - at this point we have a functional snake that only moves one direction
2. now: design choices...
   - my strat: model how _I_ would play
    - we have up to 4 choices
    - rule out impossible choices
      - if 0 possible choices we're dead
      - if 1 possible choice take it
      - if 2+ then weigh each move using a few different strategies (introduce random strat)
      - choose the one with the highest weight
    - this works OK but needs more strats
    - a more advanced strat: floodfill to avoid dead-ends
      - but we know something about snakes so can modify it
    - note about concurrency. Everything here is single-threaded, except at a webserver level. No shared data between requests so no synchronisation needed.

    - this works OK but we need more flexibility to have different strats depending on what's going on. add modes for high-level objectives
        - needing food
        - being defensive or agressive

    - how to improve this snake?
      - play real games, study outcomes, look for situations where the snake did something wrong
        - example: using a* pathing
          - some recall to advanced floodfill - same technique can apply here
      - note here about sending SMS for each finished game
        - how to determine result?
        - why is this a bad idea?
    - what is the problem with this approach?
      - too many edge cases. Just _one more_ if statement


** Section 3: How to build a better-than-okay battlesnake (10 mins)

 Monte Carlo
   - Explain what it is
   - Simple example: rolling 2 dice
   - Needs: accurate simluation, good evaluation function, performance, thread management

 Full ML
   - Never tried but seems cool (find the blog post)
